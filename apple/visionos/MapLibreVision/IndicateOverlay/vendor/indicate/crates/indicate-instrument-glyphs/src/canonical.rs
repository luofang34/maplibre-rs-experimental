//! The canonical serialization the content hash is taken over.
//!
//! The canonical form is a fixed little-endian byte layout with no
//! timestamps, padding, or platform-dependent ordering, so the same glyph
//! data always produces the same bytes and therefore the same hash. The
//! layout is:
//!
//! - header (8 bytes): manifest version (u16), cell width, cell height,
//!   advance, baseline (u8 each), glyph count (u16);
//! - then, per glyph in [`crate::font`] order: character (u32), advance
//!   (u8), and the seven bitmap rows.
//!
//! [`RECORDED_HASH`] is [`indicate_sha256::sha256`] of this form, evaluated
//! at compile time over the shipped glyphs, so verification compares live
//! data against a hash the build itself produced.
