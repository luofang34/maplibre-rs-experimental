//! The mandatory character vocabulary the glyph pack must cover.
//!
//! [`PANEL_VOCABULARY`] is derived from the strings the
//! `indicate-instrument-panels` crate emits: every `text(...)` literal and
//! every `fmt_label!` template across the PFD and HSI. Digits come from the
//! tape, rose, and readout numerals; `-` from dashes and negative readouts;
//! `.` and `°` from the distance and heading/course/wind labels; the
//! uppercase letters from the fixed labels (`IAS`, `ALT`, `ATT`, `GS`,
//! `WIND`, `DIST NM`, `CRS`, the `N`/`E`/`S`/`W` rose marks, and the
//! `V`/`G` deviation tags); and `k`/`t` from the `kt` speed unit.
//!
//! [`FLAG_VOCABULARY`] adds the simulation and conformality labels that
//! each surface must render for requirements AIR-FLAG-007 and AIR-BAS-001;
//! they draw from the full uppercase set plus the slash separator.
//!
//! A completeness test resolves every character in these lists against the
//! pack. Wiring a compile-time dependency from the panels crate onto this
//! one is deferred to the integration change; until then the vocabulary is
//! pinned by this static list rather than by re-parsing the panels source.

/// Characters the panels may emit, in canonical order: the fixed-label
/// set plus the full uppercase alphabet, because bounded waypoint idents
/// (ADR-0031) and the machine-monitoring text channel (AIR-IN-014) draw
/// arbitrary text from their closed `A`–`Z` / digit charsets, and a
/// character outside this covered set fails a frame closed.
