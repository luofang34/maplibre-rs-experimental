//! The themable half of the palette, as validated data (ADR-0029).
//!
//! A shell supplies a [`Theme`]; only a [`ValidTheme`] can reach drawing
//! code. The never-skinnable half does not depend on that boundary:
//! safety colors are separate constants in [`crate::safety`], and a
//! structure gate keeps their palette aliases inside this crate, whether
//! or not a shell supplies a theme. Validation enforces what "themable"
//! is allowed to mean:
//!
//! - **Imitation**: no themable color may sit within
//!   [`SAFETY_DISTANCE_MIN`] (max-channel RGB distance) of any warning
//!   hue — the four colored safety constants and the whole
//!   red-through-yellow segment between them — so a theme cannot
//!   manufacture or camouflage failure and caution colors.
//!   [`crate::safety::ANNUNCIATION_WHITE`] is exempt by design: primary
//!   symbology is legitimately white, and advisory rows signal by stack
//!   position, not hue.
//! - **Contrast**: primary symbology must keep at least
//!   [`CONTRAST_LUMA_MIN`] of luma against every ground it draws over —
//!   the panel, the readout boxes, both halves of the horizon, and the
//!   tape background composited over each horizon half at its declared
//!   alpha. Separately, the colored annunciation hues must keep
//!   [`SAFETY_CONTRAST_LUMA_MIN`] of luma against the panel and box
//!   grounds they paint over, so a theme cannot bury a failure flag in
//!   an equiluminant ground (the red-on-green deficiency case).
//! - **Opacity**: every themable color paints at full alpha except the
//!   tape background, which keeps at least [`TAPE_ALPHA_MIN`] so tapes
//!   stay legible over any horizon — no theme can fade symbology
//!   toward invisibility.
//! - **Source identity**: GPS and radio-nav guidance colors must stay
//!   [`SAFETY_DISTANCE_MIN`] apart — source class survives theming. The
//!   active-mode color keeps the same distance from both, because a
//!   mode annunciation that wears a guidance color says a receiver is
//!   guiding when what it names is an automation state.
//!
//! The thresholds are an explicit assurance decision, not an emergent
//! property of the defaults.
