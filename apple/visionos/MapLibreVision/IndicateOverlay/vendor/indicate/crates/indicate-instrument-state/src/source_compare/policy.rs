//! The airframe source-selection policy: thresholds, persistence,
//! hysteresis, priority, manual selection, reversion, and return-to-primary,
//! all in one validated place.
//!
//! Every knob the comparator reads lives here, constructed only through
//! [`AirframeSourcePolicy::new`] or [`AirframeSourcePolicy::simulator`], so an
//! inverted agree/miscompare band (which would let the miscompare state
//! chatter) or an empty priority order cannot exist. The simulator profile's
//! numbers are benchmark data for the simulator display only; they imply no
