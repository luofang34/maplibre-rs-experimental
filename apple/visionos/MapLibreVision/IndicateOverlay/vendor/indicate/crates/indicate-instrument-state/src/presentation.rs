//! SO(3)-safe attitude presentation: geometry from the physical down
//! vector, and the unusual-attitude tier machine (ATT-01).
//!
//! The canonical display attitude is the validated unit quaternion; the
//! horizon geometry derives from where the world's down vector points in
//! the body frame, using only quadratic quaternion forms so `q` and `-q`
//! produce bit-identical output. Display pitch is the nose's angle to
//! the horizontal; display bank rotates the horizon and stays continuous
//! through the vertical, where it is *held* (the parameter chart is
//! singular there, the rendered geometry is not). Sky stays above the
//! horizon line whenever `|bank| < 90°`; inverted flight reads as bank
//! beyond 90°, never as a relabeled sky/ground.
//!
//! Tier decisions (unusual entry/exit, chevrons, declutter) come from an
//! [`AirframeDisplayProfile`] with explicit entry/exit hysteresis. The
//! simulator profile carries fixed-wing benchmark numbers as data; it
//! implies no aircraft approval.
