//! Typed heading references and the single sanctioned conversion path.

//! Operational heading is an independent sample with an explicit
//! magnetic/true reference — never implicit quaternion yaw, which is
//! local-NED orientation, ill-conditioned near vertical pitch, and
//! carries no reference. Magnetic/true conversion happens in exactly
//! one place, [`convert_heading`], and only with a valid magnetic
//! variation sample whose sign convention (east positive), source, and
//! freshness are explicit. Nothing here ever fabricates or substitutes
//! a reference.
