//! Function-specific comparison metrics: circular heading, q/-q-invariant
//! attitude, datum-qualified altitude, and explicit scalar/vector units.
//!
//! Each metric decides its own notion of "same datum" and "how far apart".
//! None converts across datums or units silently — a cross-datum pair is
//! not comparable, never coerced into agreement or disagreement. A
//! difference between same-unit samples is expressed in the metric's
//! canonical unit (radians, meters, meters/second), so a policy threshold
//! has exactly one meaning regardless of the unit a source reports in.
