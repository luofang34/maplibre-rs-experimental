//! Per-display-function source comparison, miscompare, and deterministic
//! reversion (SRC-01).
//!
//! A display function (attitude, heading, altitude, airspeed) may be fed by
//! several independent candidate sources. This module compares only the
//! samples that are genuinely simultaneous and on the same datum, decides
//! which source a panel displays, and annunciates disagreement — without
//! ever averaging sources, voting, or picking the closest-looking value.
//!
//! Comparison is honest about what it cannot establish. Two sources that
//! disagree are ambiguous: the comparator keeps the priority-selected source
//! and raises a miscompare rather than guessing which is correct, unless
//! independent integrity evidence justifies a selection. Stale, reordered,
//! old-epoch, skewed, or datum-incompatible data are never treated as
//! simultaneous valid samples. Selection follows a validated
//! [`AirframeSourcePolicy`]; reversion away from a failed primary and the
//! return to it are governed so neither can chatter.
//!
//! Software comparison alone is not evidence of hardware independence: this
//! module claims no physical independence, no common-cause mitigation, and
//! no certification credit. It is pure, bounded, allocation-free, and reads
//! no interior clock — time enters only as caller-supplied milliseconds.
