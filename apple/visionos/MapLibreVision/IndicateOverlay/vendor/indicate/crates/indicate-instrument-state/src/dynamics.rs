//! Typed turn and slip/skid inputs (DYN-01).

//! Body-axis yaw rate is not a turn indication: at nonzero roll or
//! pitch, body `r`, heading rate, track rate, and rotation about local
//! vertical are different quantities. The turn vocabulary here makes
//! the basis explicit and gives body rate NO representation — a feeder
//! cannot label body `r` as a turn rate even by mistake, and the
//! display never derives one from attitude rates.
//!
//! Axes and signs: turn rate is positive turning RIGHT (clockwise from
//! above), radians/second about the local vertical per the declared
//! basis. Slip/skid input is lateral specific force along body +Y
//! (right), meters/second²; the coordination ball displaces OPPOSITE
//! the lateral specific force, so a positive (rightward) force shows
//! the ball deflected LEFT. Both conventions are symmetric and pinned
//! by tests.
