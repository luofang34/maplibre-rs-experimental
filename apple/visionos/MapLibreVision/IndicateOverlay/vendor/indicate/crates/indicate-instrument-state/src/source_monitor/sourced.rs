//! The inseparable value-and-source result.
//!
//! A displayed value can only be obtained together with the source it came
//! from: [`Sourced`] holds both, is built only from a single selected
//! candidate, and exposes no constructor that pairs a value with a foreign
//! source. A panel therefore cannot render one source's value under another
//! source's label, and on reversion the value and the label switch together
//! because they are one value.
