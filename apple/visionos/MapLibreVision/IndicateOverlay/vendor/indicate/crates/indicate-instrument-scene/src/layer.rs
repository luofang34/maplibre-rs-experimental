//! The frozen scene-layer and safety-compositor contract.
//!
//! A *layered scene* partitions its commands into bounded, named,
//! z-ordered criticality bands so a compositor can guarantee that
//! optional background imagery never covers, suppresses, or prevents
//! primary flight information, warnings, or failure indications
//! (AC 25-11B's mixed-criticality display concern, applied to this IR).
//!
//! Contract rules, enforced by [`validate_layers`]:
//!
//! - Each present layer appears at most once, opened and closed by
//!   matching [`Cmd::BeginLayer`]/[`Cmd::EndLayer`] markers, in strictly
//!   ascending [`LayerId`] order. Encoding order *is* z-order: painters
//!   run the commands front to back exactly as encoded, so a validated
//!   scene cannot paint background over a critical band.
//! - Layers never nest, and every drawing command sits inside exactly
//!   one layer.
//! - Every layer contains one mandatory outer save/restore envelope.
//!   Commands outside that envelope, a restore below it, or a save left
//!   open at layer end fail the frame. The envelope covers transform,
//!   clip, and paint state, so no lower band can affect a higher band.
//! - Frames are bounded: at most [`MAX_LAYER_COMMANDS`] commands per
//!   layer, [`MAX_STACK_DEPTH`] saved graphics states, and
//!   [`MAX_SCENE_BYTES`] encoded bytes per scene.
//! - Unknown *opcodes* inside a layer are counted skips (version
//!   policy, ADR-0017); an unknown *layer id* fails the whole frame at
//!   decode, because content whose criticality cannot be placed must
//!   not be painted. Extending [`LayerId`] therefore requires a scene
//!   format version bump, unlike ordinary appended opcodes.
//! - One frame is one encoded scene. Which production a frame is —
//!   its generation — is the transport's concern, not encoded per
//!   layer. Each layer is owned by exactly one producer per frame —
//!   the duplicate rule makes split ownership structurally impossible.
//!
//! The SVS/raster boundary: backend-owned raster or depth imagery (such
//! as an SVS terrain layer) composes strictly *below* [`LayerId::Attitude`],
//! in the band [`LayerId::Background`] occupies. A scene rendered with no
//! background layer at all must still contain its complete critical
//! overlay — panels guarantee that, and the invariance is pinned by
//! tests in `indicate-instrument-panels`.
