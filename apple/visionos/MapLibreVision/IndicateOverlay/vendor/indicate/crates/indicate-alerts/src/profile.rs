//! The alert policy: per-class escalation deadlines and inhibit wiring.
//!
//! Aircraft-specific inhibit schedules never live in the manager; they live
//! in a validated [`AlertProfile`], constructed like the display profiles
//! in `indicate-instrument-state` — through a constructor that rejects an
//! ill-formed policy up front. Validation refuses a zero escalation
//! deadline, more inhibit rules than the fixed budget, a rule that would
//! inhibit a warning, and a rule naming an identity this build does not
//! know. [`AlertProfile::simulator`] is benchmark data only and implies no
//! aircraft approval.
