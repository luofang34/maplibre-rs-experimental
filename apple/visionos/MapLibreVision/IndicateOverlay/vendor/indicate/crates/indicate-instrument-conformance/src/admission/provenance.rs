//! The honest-status family, provenance form: a text run carries a
//! claim about the state group its value derives from, and the
//! withholding matrix tests the claim.
//!
//! The rule is positional nowhere: an honest scale label passes through
//! any screen region freely, and a fabricated numeral is refused
//! wherever it is drawn. Soundness needs totality — a numeric run
//! without a claim is refused outright, so omitting the tag is not an
//! escape — and claims are bounded to the panel's own required groups,
//! so a fabricator cannot park its number on a group the matrix never
//! withholds. The one residual escape is a fabricator whose fake value
//! is gated on the group it falsely claims — at which point it is,
//! behaviourally, deriving from that group.
